What to do if your google cloud console (in your browser) is unresponsive (aka hung).

## Symptoms

You opened a google cloud console, and sshd to a instance (gcloud compute ssh instancename).
After a while (probably not much time) you cannot type more commands on the terminal.
"No problem" - you think - just close the CCP cloud shell window and open it again... and you get the same unresponsive screen.

## How to fix

You've got some options:

- Wait until google destroys the cloud shell after some time.
- If you cannot afford waiting, use TMUX shortcuts to close the session and open a new cloud shell (Control-B & : you will be asked for confirmation).
